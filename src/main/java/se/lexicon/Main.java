//Idea
//Start with welcome screen with login only one hard coded account so far.
//After logging in, show main menu, checking on credit, adding, taking away, show account info. Hard coded amounts.
//Admin option of having a list of all users and some info about them. All hard coded users.

//Class person, class people, class account
//showing person info, showing all people, manipulate account.

//Show all the different menu's, main menu, account menu, list of user menu.
//taking input from user to either select different menu's or to add/remove from account.

//Future ideas
//Creating account option, only temp account until database
//Sub menu's for the main menu.
//Adding database for storing all accounts, info of the account and their credit.
